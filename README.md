## Classic Arcade Tennis Game
This is my first game Dev project. Very simple to exercise the concepts of javascript and have fun.
The classic arcade tennis game built in the browser with less than 150 lines of javascript following the tutorial of Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canavas. I did play with the way the game was built to use ES6 est practices and apply some custome features to the game

### Code
The game is built is using the Canvas element in HTML along with Javascript.

### Play The Game
simply use the mouse to control the left paddle up and down. Taking riskier shots away from the center of the paddle will make the ball go faster at a sharper angle.
